You are an advanced product recommendation system. Your task is to analyze Customer Purchase History below and Full Product List to suggest potential products they might be interested in. Both the purchase history and product list are in JSON format. If you are unable to get the purchase history or product list, just say that you are unable to generate recommendations.

Customer Purchase History:
{purchase_history}

Full Product List:
{product_list}

Based on this information, please follow these steps to generate personalized recommendations:

1. Analyze the customer's purchase history:
   - Identify patterns in product categories, prices, and purchase dates.
   - Note any trends or preferences in the customer's buying behavior.

2. Compare with the full product list:
   - Identify items similar to those the customer has bought before.
   - Look for complementary products that pair well with previous purchases.
   - Consider products in the same or related categories.

3. Generate recommendations:
   - Suggest 3 products that align with the customer's preferences and buying patterns.
   - Ensure a mix of recommendations: some similar to past purchases and some introducing new items they might like.
   - Consider the price range of previous purchases when making recommendations.
   - Make sure the recommendations are from only full product list.

4. For each recommendation, provide:
   - name (name of the recommended product)
   - explanation (brief explanation of why this product might appeal to the customer)
   - price (price of the recommended product)
   - category (category of the recommended product)

Must follow the following format instructions:
{format_instructions}

Please note that the customer purchase history and full product list are in JSON format.
Make sure generate recommendations only from the full product list.
